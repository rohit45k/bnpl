Demo version of the BNPL Official website made while I was an intern there.
It uses ReactJS and TailwindCSS as main techs for the frontend.

## Demo: https://bhupswatinetwork.netlify.app/

### To run this application on your local machine 
Pre-requisite (Node installed on the system)

1. Either download the project and extract it or clone the project using (git clone https://github.com/rohit45k/bnpl.git)
2. Open the project in the terminal or VS Code (reccomended) and run the command **npm install**
3. It will start the project on **localhost:3000**
